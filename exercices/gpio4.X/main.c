 * A LED is connected to RB15 and a push-button is connected to RB14.
 * When the button is pressed, the LED is turned on for 5s.
 * If the button is pressed again during this 5s perido, this period is reset.
 * For eample, if the button is pressed again after 2s, the LED will stay on
 * during 7s.

/* We will use a software timer: a variable is incremented at a given period
 * (1ms in our case). It allows us to split a long delay in smaller ones.
 * The main loop is executed once between each small delay, allowing it to
 * react to events (the button pressing).
 * Here, the execution time of the main loop is neglected. */
